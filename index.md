## Introduction

Multiple questionnaires have been developed to quantify the phenomenology of ASCs. Here, we provide an overview on available psychometric tools, their conceptual background and construction, and validation. Some questionnaires were designed to cover a broad range of different experiences (e.g. the Altered States of Consciousness Rating scale), others are designed to assess specific ASC phenomena (e.g. the Watts Connectedness Scale), and others were designed to assess the phenomena induced by a specific consciousness modifying technique (CMT). Based on their scope and on and prevalence in previous research, we aim to provide aid to decide which questionnaire can be best for a specific study. We discuss the tools in approximate order of prevalence/popularity.
Table 1 gives an overview of the questionnaires in this collection, including some of their basic properties and key references. The most recent (and recommended version) is marked in bold. We included where currently new versions are under development.

## Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scales (ASC-R)
The currently used version(s) of the Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scale (ASC-R) (Dittrich et al., 2006, 2010) originated from two former versions and was originally developed in German. The ASC-R has become the most frequently used psychometric tools in the assessment of ASC phenomena. The development of the scale followed the assumption that ASCs have a common core that is independent of the particular induction method (ethiology-independent dimensions of altered states). Therefore, in contrast to other instruments, the ASC-R is supposed to investigate characteristics of ASCs that are invariant across various methods to induce ASCs, including both pharmacological (e.g., psilocybin, ketamine, DMT, MDMA) and non-pharmacological induction methods (e.g., sensory deprivation, hypnosis, autogenic training). However, it is noticeable in the item selection, that the original authors had a research focus on the effects of psychedelics. Over the course of more than 30 years, the questionnaire underwent several refinements. Due to a lack of systematic curation, there is currently different versions in use and confusion about how to analyze them and present results. To support future research we summarize the history of the questionnaire with its different versions and point to unfortunate ambiguities in how data is currently reported. 
APZ
The name APZ is based on the original German name: Abnorme Psychische Zustände (abnormal mental states).  An initial item collection was based on several self-assessment questionnaires on ASCs, and psychiatric rating scales, which resulted in a 158-item questionnaire version. In a series of experiments, which included data from variable induction methods, as well as factor and cluster analyses, the item pool was reduced to 72. These items comprise three common dimensions of ASC experiences: Oceanic Boundlessness (OBN), which measuring positive symptoms of dissolution of boundaries between self and surroundings; Dread of Ego Dissolution (DED) measuring negative symptoms of dissolution of boundaries between self and surroundings, and Visionary Reconstruction (VRS) measuring perceptual changes and imagination (Dittrich, 1985).
OAV
The name OAV uses the first letters of the German names of the three main dimensions of the APZ (Ozeanische Selbstentgrenzung (OSE = OBN); Angstvolle Ich-Auflösung (AIA = DED) und Visuelle Restrukturalisierung (VRS)). For the OAV version, the questionnaire was revised in terms of conceptualization, wording, and form in the scope of an unpublished master thesis (Bodmer, 1989). The most important modification was the replacement of the former dichotomous response format by visual analog scales to allow the assessment of the intensity of effects (Bodmer et al., 1994).
5D-ASC (or OAVAV)
The common core dimensions OBN, DED and VRS were complemented by two additional empirically derived scales: Auditory Alterations (AUA) and Vigilance Reduction (VIR). These scales assess changes in auditory perception such as hallucinations and drowsiness or clouding of consciousness, respectively. As opposed to the former three, these additional dimensions are considered rather specific to certain induction methods (Dittrich et al., 2006, 2010), and their validation is not as good as the one of the main three dimensions (See below). The 5D-ASC version with 96-items that comprise 5 dimensions has become a standard tool for the assessment of effects of psychedelics (including clinical studies), and also a Handbook for the analysis is available (in German). 
For the analysis Mean scores of the items that belong to the corresponding dimension are calculated and expressed as percentage of maximum score (for convenience the original print version uses corresponding visual analog scales of 10cm length). 
Note: In some older publications one can find a sum score, instead of a mean percentage score, which causes problems for comparability as the dimensions contain different amounts of items. In the Altered States Database, such data has been converted (typically after confirmation from the authors of the accurate number of items). It is advised to report data, as percentage of maximum score.
11-ASC
Several methodological shortcomings of the 5D-ASC construction motivated a reanalysis which revealed a new analysis scheme for a subset of 42 items of the ASC-R (Studerus et al., 2010). This analysis was based on only the 66 items belonging to the three main dimensions of the 5D-ASC (the original OAV dimensions). Re-examination of the factorial structure was based on psilocybin and ketamine data and revealed that an 11-factorial model is suitable to fit the data and increases scale homogeneity (Studerus et al., 2010). Corresponding scales were named as: (1) Experience of Unity, (2) Spiritual Experience, (3) Blissful State, (4) Insightfulness, (5) Disembodiment, (6) Impaired Control and Cognition, (7) Anxiety, (8) Complex Imagery, (9) Elementary Imagery, (10) Audio-Visual Synesthesia, and (11) Changed Meaning of Percepts. These eleven factors can be regarded as basic/elementary subscales of the three original scales, which describe rather high-order concepts. 
### Important notes
Note 1: Please note that the 11-factorial analysis scheme presented by Studerus et al. (2010) revealed 11 factors (!) and not 11 dimensions. Unfortunately, the original publication of the analysis scheme did not contain a suggestion for a new name, and multiple authors (including ourselves) started to name it “11D-ASC”. However, this is appears not appropriate and instead we suggest now to speak about the ASC-R to refer to the full questionnaire with 96-items, which can be analyzed according to the 5D-ASC or the 11-ASC analysis scheme. 
Note 2: Please note that the 11 factors of the 11-ASC can be assigned to the three main dimensions of the 5D-ASC. Unfortunately, some publications contain a wrong assignment of the 11 scales where the Disembodiment factor is assigned to DED (e.g. Vollenweider & Kometer 2010). However, the items that comprise the Disembodiment factor are taken from OBN and should be assigned correspondingly (Compare how they are displayed e.g. in Hirschfeld & Schmidt 2021 or Hirschfeld et al. 2023).
Note 3:  It should be noted that the three main dimensions of the 5D-ASC are calculated from the original set of 66 items. If only a 42-item version was applied, it is not possible to calculate the scores for OBN, DED or VUS. It is neither valid to take the mean score of the scales (mean of means), nor is it valid to take the mean score of all items belonging to the corresponding dimensions.
Note 4: It is not clear to us what the situation with regards to Copyrights of the 5D-ASC is. The original publication states that the copyrights are with “PSIN PLUS Publicationes, 2006”. However, it appears that the corresponding publisher is highly limited in the responsiveness with regards to placing orders or issuing bills for license fees. Potentially the publisher does not exist anymore (We cannot find any traces online - If somebody has more information on this – please let us know and we are happy to make this information available here).
Validation, Translations, Adaptations and Future Developments
In terms of quality criteria, the German 5D-ASC and its former versions were repeatedly assessed as reliable and valid instruments. The validation of the APZ revealed good results regarding internal consistency, test-retest reliability as well as convergent and discriminant validity (Dittrich, 1985; Dittrich et al., 1985). Assessments of internal consistency estimated by Hoyt (0.89 to 0.95) and test-retest correlation (0.75<r<0.82) suggest the OAV’s reliability (Bodmer, 1989). Internal consistency (estimated by Hoyt) was also good for the 5D-ASC’s additional scales: 0.88 (AUA) and 0.88 (VIR) (Dittrich et al., 2006, 2010). The proposed 11-factorial structure was assessed in a pooled data analysis of several experimental studies, which were however limited to pharmacological induction methods of ASCs. This evaluation indicates high reliability for all scales with a mean Cronbach’s alpha of 0.83. Correlation with the EWL-60-S (short form of the Adjective Word List) and the STAI-S (state version of the State-Trait-Anxiety Inventory) suggest convergent and discriminant validity of this scale (Studerus et al., 2010). Together with alternative reliability assessments, these results demonstrate its suitability as a reliable and valid psychometric tool for the assessment of subjective experiences occurring during ASCs.
Originally developed in German, the Altered State of Consciousness Rating Scale was translated into English and several other languages (Studerus et al., 2012). Recent application in neuroimaging studies demonstrates its wide acceptance and significance for the scientific study of ASCs (e.g., (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016a)). However, this questionnaire is, except for its earlier version APZ, is to the best of our knowledge not validated in other languages than German. 
A adaption for the assessment of effects of Floating-REST has been reported and termed Experienced Deviation from the Normal State questionnaire (EDN) (Kjellgren et al., 2001). 
A current trend in the field is to develop short and ultra-short version of questionnaires to take less time in the assessment. A 22-item version was used in the Altered eXperience Project (Schmidt et al. 2023), and we have heard about current attempts to validate a 11-item version (personal communication - We will post updates as soon as we have more information).


## Acknowledgement
The information in this section were collected over multiple years and many people contributed in different ways. Within two study projects in 2017-18 within teaching activities in the MSc program Cognitive Science at the Institute for Cognitive Science at the University of Osnabrück inital information on questionnaires was collected. These study projects were led by Dr. Timo Torsten Schmidt together with Dr. Axel Kohler and Dr. Uwe Friese. After completion of these study projects, several students from different institutions contributed to the collection within internships, labrotations and similar research related activities. 
It was initially planned to publish an overview article and a corresponding manuscript was submitted to a journal. The editor of the journal advised to find a different format for publication and we agree that the accumulated collection of questionnaires (+corresponding background information) will be better accessible in a fully openly access format, which can regularily updated.
